Unreal Committer
================

*This is what happens when you look for inspiration at 2AM.*

Description
-----------

Unreal Committer monitors your GitHub repositories (support for Gitorious and
BitBucket coming) for new commits and updates all connected clients via
WebSocket with info about the commit and author, as well as a charming sound
effect from my twitch-gaming days.

Implementation
--------------
UC is written in CoffeeScript using Node.JS and the Faye websocket library.


Why?
----
I think it's a morale booster. Also it seems like an awesome idea at 2AM. Plus,
it's a tribute to all John Carmack, Cliffy Blizenski, and all the folken behind
the games that nearly caused me to flunk out of high school.
